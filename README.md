# trainerEntityCrudMVC
A Maven / MVC small full stack 2-week miniproject, utilizing spring boot, hibernate entities and annotations, implementing Crud procedures with an SQL Database.

For Front end : HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap/JSTL. Web pages are JSP.

This was an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp 10, Peoplecert.

The database can be recreated through the file "trainer_schema_sql_pk.sql" that can be found on root/home folder structure.

You can use workbench or any other sql database client to achieve that! Enjoy!
