# trainerEntityCrudMVC
A Maven / MVC small full stack project, utilizing spring boot, hibernate entities and annotations, implementing Crud procedures with an SQL Database.

The database can be recreated through the file "trainer_schema_sql_pk.sql" that can be found on root/home folder structure.

You can use workbench or any other Client to achieve that! Enjoy!
